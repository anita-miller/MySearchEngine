Things we could improve:
- Config isn't using external environment
- Remove SelectMenu.scala
- class ConsoleIo() -> should be an object
- Lot of use of String, could use models to restrict
- IndexBuilder.createIndex could return an IO (or otherwise take the file contents)
- Remove deprecated functions in IndexBuilder.createIndex
- Handle invalid json
- Don't silently ignore invalid json types
- Duplication of `jsonToListofString`
- ResultEnricher.enrichDocument - extract some smaller methods
---- design
- Extract Zendesk specific domain mappings from ResultEnricher, make it configurable
- Improve the test coverage
  - eg no CLI testing
